## Overview

This is a simple list program designed to allow the user to manage a simple list. There is already data on it and the user
can modify the contents of the list. The user is able to add, remove, join, and split list entries.

## Usage

You first need to use ```npm install``` to ensure you have all the required dependencies and ensure that you have the expo-cli by running
```npm install -g expo-cli```. Once installed, you can open the project through a terminal window by navigating to the project directory and running ```expo start```, from there you can use the provided QR code and the ExpoGo app to run the application on your local device.


## Reflection

This was a fun project, I have some minor JavaScript experience so something did feel
familar but overall this is new to me and it was fun to play around with. This is my first
time with mobile development so making mobile experiencecs was a bit different. Some things
reminded me of HTML like the tags but others were different and took a little but to get used to.
For example, getting things to render on the screen to a bit of trial and error for me. Also initialing
default functions was and still is confusing to me.
